  "script": "I completely hear what you're saying about the defective laptop charger, and I genuinely wish I could process a full cash return for you today. Unfortunately, because it's technically past the fourteen-day window, the computer system physically won't let me authorize a standard refund. As a matter of policy, we simply can't do a direct refund, but I can certainly offer you a direct product exchange or equivalent store credit instead. Would you prefer to just grab a brand new charger off the shelf right now? That is realistically the absolute best I can directly do under these strict corporate rules.",

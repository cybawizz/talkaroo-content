  "script": "The entire situation with the restaurant reservation was a complete disaster last night. At first, we actually got completely lost for about forty-five minutes because the navigation app sent us to the wrong address. We were literally driving in dark circles around a huge, empty parking lot. Eventually, after asking three different strangers for directions, we finally found the actual hidden entrance around the back. By the time we sat down, we were practically starving.",

  "prompt": "Identify the speaker’s concern.",
  "script": "Listen, I absolutely don't mind you playing your acoustic guitar in the living room during the afternoon. I'm genuinely fine with hearing your music while I'm making dinner or studying. However, it's getting way too loud after eleven o'clock at night, and I honestly can't sleep with that much noise traveling through the thin walls. Would it be somewhat possible for you to practice earlier in the evening instead? I really need a solid eight hours of sleep before my early morning neurobiology classes.",

      "The speaker absolutely hates all music and demands total silence in the apartment at all times.",

  },
  "explanation": "The speaker explicitly uses concession ('I absolutely don't mind...', 'I'm fine with...') to carefully soften the blow before delivering their core late-night complaint."

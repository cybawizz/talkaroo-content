  "script": "When it comes to my core management philosophy, I consistently prioritize absolute clarity over rigid adherence to traditional corporate hierarchy. In daily practice, that specific approach means requiring aggressively short meeting updates and assigning highly clear, singular owners for every single project task. It completely eliminates the confusing ambiguity that so frequently derails large, cross-functional engineering teams. To be completely honest, I've found that people genuinely thrive when they know exactly what's expected of them. That's exactly how I successfully led my previous department.",

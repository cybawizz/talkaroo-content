  "script": "The entire situation with finding our rental house on the first night was a complete disaster. At first, we actually got completely lost for about forty-five minutes because the navigation app sent us to the wrong side of the island. We were driving in circles around a huge, empty resort complex in the pitch dark. Eventually, after asking three different security guards for directions, we finally found the actual hidden entrance around the back. By the time we unlocked the door, we were practically exhausted.",

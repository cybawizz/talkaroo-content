  "script": "I completely understand that the hotel is currently fully booked because of the massive convention in town. It clearly sounds like moving me to a different, quieter room tonight is basically impossible. However, if that's simply not possible today, could we perhaps schedule a guaranteed room change for early tomorrow morning instead? I genuinely can't spend my entire five-day stay right next to that loud elevator. I'll gladly pack my bags tonight so I'm completely ready to move before breakfast.",

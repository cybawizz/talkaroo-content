  "script": "Look, I completely understand that the feedback on the proposal sounded a bit harsh in the comments. However, it's absolutely crucial to remember that I'm reacting to the idea itself, not the person who suggested it. We all share the exact same goal of making this project as successful as possible. It's just that this particular technical approach has some serious flaws we need to address. Let's try to keep the discussion strictly focused on the data.",

  "script": "Overall, the entire engineering department is progressing incredibly well with the initial frontend build phase. We practically finished the user dashboard three full days ahead of our scheduled timeline. However, honestly speaking, the main critical risk right now is the strict third-party vendor integration. That extremely complex API connection could potentially delay our massive QA testing phase by at least a week. We really need to actively monitor that specific software dependency going forward.",

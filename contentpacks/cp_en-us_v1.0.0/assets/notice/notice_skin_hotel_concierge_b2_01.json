  "script": "If you're planning to take a taxi to the airport this afternoon, I wouldn't recommend taking the standard main route. As a matter of fact, the primary highway is completely blocked off right now due to some unexpected emergency roadworks. Because of that major delay, you'll definitely need to ask your driver to take a slight detour through the back streets. I'd actually highly suggest leaving the hotel about thirty minutes earlier than originally planned. It might be a minor inconvenience, but it will absolutely ensure you don't miss your flight.",

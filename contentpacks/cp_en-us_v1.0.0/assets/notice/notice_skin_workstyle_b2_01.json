  "script": "I genuinely always enjoy working closely with the European marketing team on complex projects. Compared to our local domestic branch, that specific group is dramatically more organized and infinitely more proactive. There are practically no missed deadlines, and their professional communication protocols are always incredibly well-maintained. To be completely honest, it has fundamentally changed my perspective on how distributed teams should actually function. I seriously don't think I could manage working with a disorganized team anymore.",

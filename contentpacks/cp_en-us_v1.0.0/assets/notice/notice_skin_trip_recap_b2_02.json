  "script": "I was absolutely shocked when we finally walked into the main museum exhibit on Tuesday. Honestly, I really didn't expect the place to be that incredibly busy on a random weekday afternoon. There were literally hundreds of tourists lining up outside just waiting for an audio guide to become available. I mean, who goes to an ancient history museum right in the middle of a beautiful beach day? It completely threw off our entire sightseeing itinerary for the afternoon.",

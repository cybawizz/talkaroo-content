  "script": "I completely understand that you're quite hesitant about committing to this new neighborhood right away. It's obviously a huge decision, and we really shouldn't rush into signing a long-term lease blindly. However, at the exact same time, we do need to find a place to stay fairly soon. Could we perhaps just meet in the middle and try staying at a rental here for a week? That way, we can test out the area thoroughly before making anything completely permanent.",

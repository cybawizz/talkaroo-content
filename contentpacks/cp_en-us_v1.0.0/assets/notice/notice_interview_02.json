It's obviously something we also value very highly here at this specific software company. However, to help me fully visualize how you actually put those management ideas into practice on a daily basis, could you perhaps give a highly concrete example from your very last role? I'm particularly interested in hearing about a time when that intense transparency actually prevented a major project failure. It would genuinely help me understand your specific leadership style much better.",

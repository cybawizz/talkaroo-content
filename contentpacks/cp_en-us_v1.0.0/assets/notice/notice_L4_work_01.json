  "script": "We're starting to go in circles a bit with this discussion, to be honest. To make sure we're actually being productive, let's separate the distinct issues here: the expanding project scope versus the current lack of staffing. If we try to solve both of those massive problems simultaneously, we simply aren't going to get anywhere today. Let's tackle the timeline first, and then we can look at the budget. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to everyone?",

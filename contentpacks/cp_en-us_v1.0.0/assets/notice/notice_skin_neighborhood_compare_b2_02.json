  "script": "I genuinely hear what you're saying about how much you absolutely love living in the historic district right now. But when you say it's so incredibly convenient, what do you mean exactly? Are you primarily talking about the local public transport, the nearby grocery shops, or something else entirely? I'm simply trying to get a much better sense of what makes it so appealing to you on a daily basis. My current neighborhood is really lacking in basic, walkable amenities.",

  "script": "I was absolutely shocked when we finally walked into the emergency all-hands meeting on Friday afternoon. Honestly, I really didn't expect the main auditorium to be that incredibly packed on a random summer afternoon.

I mean, who schedules a massive company update right in the middle of peak vacation season? It completely threw off our entire departmental workflow for the rest of the busy week.",

  "script": "I completely understand that the kitchen is currently fully backed up because of the massive dinner rush. It clearly sounds like getting exactly what I ordered remade tonight is basically impossible. However, if that's simply not possible today, could we perhaps just take this mistaken appetizer off the final bill instead? I genuinely can't wait another forty-five minutes for a replacement meal. I'll gladly just eat my main course when it finally arrives.",

      "To proactively offer a reasonable, alternative compensation when the initial request is firmly denied.",
      "To aggressively demand a full refund for the entire ruined dining experience.",
      "To angrily complain about the terrible waitstaff to the general manager.",
      "To happily announce that they enjoy eating the wrong appetizers."

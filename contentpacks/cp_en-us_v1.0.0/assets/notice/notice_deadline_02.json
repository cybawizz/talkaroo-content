  "script": "It clearly sounds like the engineering team needs two full weeks of testing, but the marketing team absolutely insists on a launch announcement by Tuesday. We are fundamentally stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. As a reasonable compromise, perhaps we can ship an exclusive closed beta next week, and then deploy the full public version the week after? That strategy completely satisfies marketing's timeline while actively giving engineering the safety buffer they so desperately need. It honestly seems like the absolutely only workable solution.",

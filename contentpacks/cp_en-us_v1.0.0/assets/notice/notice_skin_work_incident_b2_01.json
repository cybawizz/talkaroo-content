  "script": "The entire situation with finding the off-site meeting location on Monday was a complete disaster. At first, we actually got completely lost for about forty-five minutes because the calendar invite sent us to the wrong corporate campus. We were driving in frantic circles around a huge, empty business park in the pouring rain. Eventually, after asking three different security guards for directions, we finally found the actual hidden conference room around the back of building C. By the time we sat down, the CEO's entire presentation was practically over.",

  "script": "This proposed city infrastructure policy is incredibly complex and guaranteed to be controversial among local residents. On the one hand, it undeniably creates significantly faster transit access for the entire downtown commercial district. However, on the other hand, it realistically might create severe economic inequality for neighborhoods located outside the primary service zone. We really need to look at the long-term data before making any irreversible final decisions. As a matter of fact, ignoring the suburban impact could be politically disastrous.",

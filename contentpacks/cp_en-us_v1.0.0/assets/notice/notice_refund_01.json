  "script": "I completely understand that your standard store policy strictly prohibits returns on open electronics after fourteen days. It plainly says exactly that on my printed receipt. However, this specific laptop charger is clearly defective straight out of the physical box, and it absolutely isn't just a case of me changing my mind. Considering I only bought it exactly fifteen days ago, could you perhaps make a rare managerial exception this one time? I honestly wouldn't be asking you this if breaking the charger was actually my own fault.",

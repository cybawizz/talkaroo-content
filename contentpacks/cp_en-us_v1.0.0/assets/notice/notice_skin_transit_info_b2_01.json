  "script": "If you're planning to take the blue line express train downtown this afternoon, I wouldn't recommend standing on this platform. As a matter of fact, the primary outbound track is completely blocked off right now due to some unexpected emergency maintenance. Because of that major system delay, you'll definitely need to take a slight detour using the local green line instead. I'd actually highly suggest leaving the station and just catching a bus if you're in a hurry. It might be a minor inconvenience, but it will absolutely ensure you aren't stuck underground forever.",

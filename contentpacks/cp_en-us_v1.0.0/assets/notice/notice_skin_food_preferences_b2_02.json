  "script": "I know you're really hesitant about completely cutting out dairy from your diet right away. It's obviously a massive lifestyle change to make overnight, and it won't be easy.

If you absolutely hate how you feel after seven days, we can easily reevaluate the situation. At the very least, we'd know we honestly tried our best.",
